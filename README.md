# Waste Recycling

This exercise is a simple OOP practice, what is simulating how the selective waste collection works.
We can make dustbin instances, and only the proper garbage instances can be thrown into the dustbin.
Paper garbages must be squeezed, and plastic garbages must be cleaned before thrown in dustbin.
The program throws exceptions by the not proper waste handlings. 

(Main class is just for test the code)
